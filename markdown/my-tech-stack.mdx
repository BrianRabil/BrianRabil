# My Tech Stack: Building Modern Web Applications

Welcome to my blog post about the technology stack I use for web development! In this post, I'll walk you through the key components that power my projects.

## Frontend

At the core of my frontend development is **Next.js**, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. Here's why I love it:

- **Performance**: Next.js optimizes my applications for speed and efficiency.
- **TypeScript Support**: Strong typing helps me catch errors early and improves code quality.
- **File-based Routing**: Simplifies the organization of my application structure.

### Styling

For styling, I rely on **Tailwind CSS**. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to:

- Rapidly prototype designs
- Maintain consistency across my projects
- Easily customize and extend styles

## Backend

While Next.js can handle many backend functionalities, I sometimes need additional services. Here's what I use:

- **Node.js**: For building scalable network applications
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework

## Database

My go-to database solution is:

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system

## Development Environment

To ensure a consistent development experience, I use:

- **Docker**: For containerization and easy deployment
- **VS Code**: My preferred code editor, with extensions like:
  - Biome for code formatting
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense for better CSS authoring

## Version Control and CI/CD

- **Git**: For version control
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment

## This Blog

Interestingly, this blog post itself is written in **MDX**, which allows me to seamlessly blend Markdown with JSX. This means I can include React components right in my blog posts!

Here's a simple example of a React component in MDX:
