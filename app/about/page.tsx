              My name is Brian Rabil, and I am UI/UX engineer based in
              Washington D.C. with over 5 years of experience in designing,
              planning, and developing digital user interfaces and user
              experiences. Over the course of my career, I have enjoyed the
              privilege of working with some of the world&apos;s most recognized
              brands.
            </p>
            <p className={`mb-5`}>
              Currently, I work for Schema Driven, a startup that provides
              enterprise-level automation software. As the lead UX Architect, I
              work closely with the engineering team to design and build
              powerful &amp; easy-to-use low-code tooling.
            </p>
            <p className={`mb-5`}>
              When I&apos;m not busy working on my various projects, I like to
              enjoy some well-deserved leisure time by reading books and
              watching low-grade reality TV with my wife and Yorkie puppy.
            </p>

              If you need an app developer for your next project, please
              don&apos;t hesitate to get in touch. I live for the days spent
              solving problems with technology - it&apos;s my passion.
