              I'm a UI/UX engineer based in the Washington D.C. area. I
              specialize in web application development with Typescript, React,
              and Redux. Over the course of my career, I've had the privilege of
              working with the CIA, Department of Defense, the Marines, Foxconn,
              SAIC, banks, hospitals, and entrepreneurs. I plan on adding more
              content to this site soon. Stay tuned!
