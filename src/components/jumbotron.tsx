                        I'm a UI/UX designer and developer based in the Washington DC area. Ever since a young age, I've been interested in the power of good design for creating impactful and meaningful experiences for users. My style is clean, functional, intuitive, corporate design. Over the course of my career, I've designed/developed solutions for the CIA, Department of Defense, the Marines, Foxconn, SAIC, several banks and hospitals, and entrepreneurs just starting out.
